## 🎮 What’s the Deal with Hunt: Showdown Aimbot?

Hunt: Showdown is brutal. You’re creeping through swamps, dodging monsters, and then BAM—sniped outta nowhere. That’s where the **aimbot** steps in.

This cheat tool gives you **unreal aim assist**, letting you lock onto targets automatically, whether they’re sprinting, crouching, or hiding behind cover. Combined with smooth tracking and hitbox targeting, you’ll go from missing shots to stacking bodies in seconds.

Headshots? Easy. Squad wipes? Common. Bounty wins? Guaranteed. 🧠💥

## 🚀 Features That Make It OP

🔒 **Auto Aim Lock** – Snaps to enemy heads or torsos instantly when triggered. High-speed tracking for fast-moving targets.

🧊 **Silent Aim** – You shoot in one direction, but hits register on enemies elsewhere. Low-key and hard to detect.

🎯 **Custom FOV Targeting** – Set your aimbot field-of-view to avoid looking sus. Make it look like pure skill.

🕹️ **Bone Selection** – Prefer chest over head for less suspicion? Choose where you want shots to land.

🔧 **Smooth Aim Control** – Adjust how fast or snappy your aimbot is. Tune it to match your playstyle.

🚫 **No Recoil/No Spread** – Every bullet lands exactly where it should. No random sprays, just precision.

💀 **Triggerbot** – Auto fires when the enemy is in your crosshair. Works great with sniper builds.

## 🆚 Why This Aimbot Stands Out

Compared to generic aimbots out there, this one’s built **just for Hunt: Showdown**. That means:

* 💣 Optimized for long-range, scoped weapons (Winfield, Mosin, Sparks)
* 🎯 Configurable for PvP *and* PvE targets (hunters + AI enemies)
* 🛡️ Supports stealth mode to bypass anti-cheat and reduce bans

Other aimbots often have **laggy tracking** or get flagged fast. This one’s smooth, customizable, and works with a clean UI menu. Pure dominance, no drama.

* **GPU:** GTX 1050 Ti or higher
